And have strong education professional with a Doctor of Philosophy - PhD focused on Quantum gate design based on Schrödinger Dynamics from Delhi University with M.Tech from NIT Rourkela and B.Tech from IETE, Delhi. He has 8 years teaching experienced and worked as Associate Professor with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry with skilled in Matlab, Quantum computation, Python and so on. 
					His mission model is focussing on quantum gate design based on the excitation of atoms and molecules with electromagnetic fields. A particular situation of this involves ion trap experiment in which the quantum electromagnetic field interacting with an ion modelled as a quantum 3D harmonics oscillators. We propose to apply this theory to atoms and quantum dots placed with the Graphene waveguide. I am planning to establish with unique proposals and ideas for setting up incubation centres where quantum Gate design based on ion trap experiments, namely making a laser field interact with a trapped ion, could be a natural method for simulating quantum gates and quantum computation algorithms.

			<h2>Quantum Rays (Q-Rays)</h2>
      <p>Quantum computing is an emerging technology that is focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory to solve problems too complex for classical computers. Classical computers struggle with complex tasks  because the bits of information they process can only take definite values of zero or one, and therefore can only represent individual states. Quantum computing  uses quantum bits or qubits the basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device. A qubit is a two-state quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics.  Research suggests that error-reduction software could play a major role in establishing near-term applications for quantum computers. 
        Software to be run on a quantum computer is quite different from software for classical computers. Programming languages such as QCL (Quantum Computer Language) are used for quantum software. Quantum Software Development Kit is used  for developing quantum algorithms that can be used in quantum computers or simulators and emulators which use classical programming languages.
<br>        
      <h2>About the Symposium</h2>
      <p>This one day symposium discusses the Government directives, user perspective,  new ideas, challenges, ongoing research and challenges in the next generation transformative quantum technologies that include quantum computers and computing, This symposium will discuss Programming model, development tools for quantum software, hybrid quantum applications, Integration and orchestration of quantum and classical components in hybrid applications and so on. The various challenges  in developing hybrid software by combining with classical infrastructures and services, integration and use of  quantum software in production will also be discussed. This one day event focuses on the challenges and opportunities in Quantum software having discussions with quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers.</div>
